Practice Problems for Module 5

The problems use the intercollegiate athletics database as described in the background document. The course website also contains CREATE TABLE and INSERT statements for Oracle, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.
    1. List the event number, date held, customer number, customer name, facility number, and facility name of 2018 events placed by Boulder customers.
    2. List the customer number, customer name, event number, date held, facility number, facility name, and estimated audience cost per person (EstCost / EstAudience) for events held on 2018, in which the estimated cost per person is less than $0.2
    3. List the customer number, customer name, and total estimated costs for Approved events. The total amount of events is the sum of the estimated cost for each event. Group the results by customer number and customer name.
    4. Insert yourself as a new row in the Customer table.
    5. Increase the rate by 10 percent of resource names equal to nurse. In MySQL, you need to place the UPDATE statement between two SET statements.
SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0;
UPDATE statement
    6. SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 1;
    7. Delete the new row added to the Customer table.
