# #StringBuilder
StringBuilder objects are like String objects, except that they can be modified. Internally, these objects are treated like variable-length arrays that contain a sequence of characters. At any point, the length and content of the sequence can be changed through method invocations.

## Nameing Conventions: Java uses CamelCase as a practice for writing names of methods, variables, classes, packages, and constants. 

Camelâ€™s case in java programming consists of compound words or phrases such that each word or abbreviation begins with a capital letter or first word with a lowercase letter, rest all with capital. Here in simpler terms, it means if there are two

| reverse() | returns the StringBuilder after reversing it. |
| ensureCapacity(int minimumCapacity) | It ensures that the capacity is atleast to the specified minimumCapacity. |
| substring(int beginIndex, int endIndex) | returns the substring from the beginIndex to the endIndex. substring is a single word the Naming convention is maintained. |
| replace(int startIndex, int endIndex, String str) | As the name suggests it is used to replace the String from a particular Start index to End index with this String which are given as parameters. |
| delete(int startIndex, int endIndex) | As the method name says it deletes the String from a specified start index to end index. |
| charAt(int index) | returns the Character at particular index. As the method name has two words, second word's Starting letter is Capitalized so as to follow the camelCase. |
