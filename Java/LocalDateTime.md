# Java LocalDateTime class
Java LocalDateTime class is an immutable date-time object that represents a date-time, with the default format as yyyy-MM-dd-HH-mm-ss.zzz. It inherits object class and implements the ChronoLocalDateTime interface.


# Nameing Conventions: Java uses CamelCase as a practice for writing names of methods, variables, classes, packages, and constants. 

Camelâ€™s case in java programming consists of compound words or phrases such that each word or abbreviation begins with a capital letter or first word with a lowercase letter, rest all with capital.
